* using -rpath to trigger static/shared lib handling is somewhat broken
  libtool chokes on install (because of missing .lai file), which isn't
  generated (as libtool assumes no -rpath means a convenience lib)
 
  http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/manual/libtool.html#Link-mode

  -static, -all-static, -static-libtool-libs, -shared, -no-install

  Maybe add 'skip-static = true' as well? [done]

* rethink 'ld-flags' vs 'libs'
  'libs' isn't used at all at this time

* cleanup of module/target specific flag handling?
  there are no longer module-specific flags; the only way to do
  this is to declare variables in a VERBATIM section and use those

* custom production (sed xxx.cpp > yyy.cpp)
  cleanup files-per-module!
