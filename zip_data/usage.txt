Creates makefiles from build descriptors for non-recursive make.

You should start it in the source root directory, all subdirectories
will be searched for files named 'build.rules'.

Flags are:
    -a directory : add a non-subdir directory to the search list
    -H           : show full documentation
    -p           : print parsed rules information to stdout and exit
    -d           : namgen debug output
    -C           : clean *all* files generated by namgen
